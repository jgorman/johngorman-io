# Menu

I am taking some time to learn ReactJS, React Native and related technologies and this is my place to try things out!

## Darkest Night Clock

I wrote the same exact night time clock app in both React.js and in React Native so that both the similarities and the differences between the two environments are clear.

## Cloud Server

I am experimenting with both front end and back end libraries and their deployment so I need to be able to easily spin up services on the open internet.

There is no easier and more flexible method for hosting than to spin up your own cloud server. I chose Linode due to simplicity and cost effectiveness. A 1GB instance costs $5 / month.

Set up [Node, Apache and SSL on Ubuntu](cloud-server).
